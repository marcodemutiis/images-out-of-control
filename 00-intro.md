# ImAgEs OuT oF CoNtRoL
Reclaiming spaces through post-photographic interventions

## ABSTRACT
Photography has played a major role historically in perpetuating and enabling social control through practices of surveillance, forensics and analysis. Throughout this module, students will first learn about image-based strategies for control that are put in place in public and networked spaces. From CCTV cameras to face recognition technologies on Instagram filters, students will learn to critically engage with hidden logics of control, and how they shape identities and behaviours through photographic technologies. 
The course will offer a series of artistic positions that subvert, disrupt and ultimately reclaim control of these spaces, including sousveillance strategies and extended documentary practices. Artistic examples will be accompanied by practical tutorials with the goal to teach students skills related to a number of image technologies: from AR in urban spaces to face filters, from CCTV camera “hacking” to projection mapping on architecture. Each student will experiment with a number of different approaches to misuse, challenge and disobey image control and reclaim urban and networked spaces through different interventions experimented throughout the module.

## LEARNING OBJECTIVES
The module aims at combining technical skills, artistic approaches as well as theoretical foundations to inform and inspire students' practice to work with these three complementary approaches. Following the idea of control and subversion through thematic weeks, students will be offered practical workshops, theoretical lectures as well as guest inputs from artists, technologists, designers, scholars and curators.
Students will acquire concepts of photography theory and media studies, and will learn creative programming skills, while developing critical and artistic approaches to image technologies and their role in physical and networked spaces.

## MODULE PROGRAM
ImAgEs OuT oF CoNtRoL is divided in 5 thematic weeks. Each week focuses on a specific image culture and technology: 

+ Week 1: surveillance, CCTV cameras, machine vision and object detection, citizen, state, discipline, sousveillance, interacting with existing image technologies, reclaiming and misusing public cameras, hacking cameras.
+ Week 2: restitution, repossessing and reclaiming through 3D scanners and depth cameras, colonialism, power structures and hegemony, heritage, economic, ownership, cultural value.
+ Week 3: public art, interventions, augmented reality, mixed reality, appropriation of space, communities, resistance, activism, protest.
+ Week 4: face filters, identity, norms, conformity, fluidity, augmented reality, aesthetics, activism.
+ Week 5: projection mapping, digital graffiti, VJ’ing, ephemeral street art, intervention, public space.
